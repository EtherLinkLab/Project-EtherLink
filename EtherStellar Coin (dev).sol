/**
 * @dev Library for reading and writing primitive types to specific storage slots.
 *
 * Storage slots are often used to avoid storage conflict when dealing with upgradeable contracts.
 * This library helps with reading and writing to such slots without the need for inline assembly.
 *
 * The functions in this library return Slot structs that contain a `value` member that can be used to read or write.
 *
 * Example usage to set ERC-1967 implementation slot:
 * ```solidity
 * contract ERC1967 {
 *     // Define the slot. Alternatively, use the SlotDerivation library to derive the slot.
 *     bytes32 internal constant _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x252fd9C54323240Cc1129beD11a1fE891fEb9be6;
 *
 *     function _getImplementation() internal view returns (address) {
 *         return StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value;
 *     }
 *
 *     function _setImplementation(address newImplementation) internal {
 *         require(newImplementation.code.length > 0);
 *         StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value = newImplementation;
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Since version 5.1, this library also support writing and reading value types to and from transient storage.
 *
 *  * Example using transient storage:
 * ```solidity
 * contract Lock {
 *     // Define the slot. Alternatively, use the SlotDerivation library to derive the slot.
 *     bytes32 internal constant _LOCK_SLOT = 0xB8258711507Deb527F8E46c09EC443F9E162D906;
 *
 *     modifier locked() {
 *         require(!_LOCK_SLOT.asBoolean().tload());
 *
 *         _LOCK_SLOT.asBoolean().tstore(true);
 *         _;
 *         _LOCK_SLOT.asBoolean().tstore(false);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: Consider using this library along with {SlotDerivation}.

 * "admin cannot fallback to proxy target".
 * 
 * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for admin actions like upgrading the proxy or changing
