/**
 * @dev Library for reading and writing primitive types to specific storage slots.
 *
 * Storage slots are often used to avoid storage conflict when dealing with upgradeable contracts.
 * This library helps with reading and writing to such slots without the need for inline assembly.
 *
 * The functions in this library return Slot structs that contain a `value` member that can be used to read or write.
 *
 * Example usage to set ERC-1967 implementation slot:
 * ```solidity
 * contract ERC1967 {
 *     // Define the slot. Alternatively, use the SlotDerivation library to derive the slot.
 *     bytes32 internal constant _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x252fd9C54323240Cc1129beD11a1fE891fEb9be6;
 *
 *     function _getImplementation() internal view returns (address) {
 *         return StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value;
 *     }
 *
 *     function _setImplementation(address newImplementation) internal {
 *         require(newImplementation.code.length > 0);
 *         StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value = newImplementation;
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Since version 5.1, this library also support writing and reading value types to and from transient storage.
 *
 *  * Example using transient storage:
 * ```solidity
 * contract Lock {
 *     // Define the slot. Alternatively, use the SlotDerivation library to derive the slot.
 *     bytes32 internal constant _LOCK_SLOT = 0xB8258711507Deb527F8E46c09EC443F9E162D906;
 *
 *     modifier locked() {
 *         require(!_LOCK_SLOT.asBoolean().tload());
 *
 *         _LOCK_SLOT.asBoolean().tstore(true);
 *         _;
 *         _LOCK_SLOT.asBoolean().tstore(false);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: Consider using this library along with {SlotDerivation}.

 * @dev This contract implements a proxy that is upgradeable by an admin.
 * 
 * To avoid https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/malicious-backdoors-in-ethereum-proxies-62629adf3357[proxy selector
 * clashing], which can potentially be used in an attack, this contract uses the
 * https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-transparent-proxy-pattern/[transparent proxy pattern]. This pattern implies two
 * things that go hand in hand:
 * 
 * 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if
 * that call matches one of the admin functions exposed by the proxy itself.
 * 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can access the admin functions, but its calls will never be forwarded to the
 * implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error that says
 * "admin cannot fallback to proxy target".
 * 
 * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for admin actions like upgrading the proxy or changing
 * the admin, so it's best if it's a dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due
 * to sudden errors when trying to call a function from the proxy implementation.
 * 
 * Our recommendation is for the dedicated account to be an instance of the {ProxyAdmin} contract. If set up this way,
 * you should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the real administrative inerface of your proxy.
